# The Adventure 
## Add Module 1 Python file to THIS PROJECT (utils_dean.py)
## created the dirbot and followed the todo's
The real adventure was trying to figure out what I was doing because I think the file name was changed or something. I'm trying to still understand it at this point.
## Once I figured out my issue, I was able to implement the code into my dean_project_setup.py
## I completed all TODO's and was able to test the code.
The screenshot shown is after I tested running it in a new terminal!
## I committed the above pieces into Git.
